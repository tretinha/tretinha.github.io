      <description>There is no denying that unit testing is dropping our team&amp;rsquo;s bug counter to nearly zero, as opposed to the mess it once was. I won&amp;rsquo;t be advocating for TDD or trying to convince you that this is the only thing you can do to ensure quality software. It&amp;rsquo;s not the only thing we did, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not the most important one.
But, if you are looking to apply unit tests to your python program, this is sort of a guide to what I think are the most important things you should know.</description>
