      <description>I have deployed two simple apps on Google&amp;rsquo;s managed version of Kubernetes, Google Kubernetes Engine. This isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for me to judge the whole thing, obviously, but I would like to write down my impressions.
First of all, there is a very &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; process. You should create your deployment manifest - which is, mostly, a file describing what your app should look like in terms of ports it&amp;rsquo;s listening to, volumes it needs, environment variables, secrets, etc.</description>

      <description>There is no denying that unit testing is dropping our team&amp;rsquo;s bug counter to nearly zero, as opposed to the mess it once was. I won&amp;rsquo;t be advocating for TDD or trying to convince you that this is the only thing you can do to ensure quality software. It&amp;rsquo;s not the only thing we did, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not the most important one.
But, if you are looking to apply unit tests to your python program, this is sort of a guide to what I think are the most important things you should know.</description>
